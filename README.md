This Python-based model compares energy costs for powering a center pivot irrigation system under three scenarios:

Grid-only

Grid + Solar

Grid + Solar + Battery

It uses rule-based logic to simulate hourly operations, factoring in time-of-use pricing, solar generation, and battery dispatch.
The project is built with dummy data but designed for adaptation to real-world use casesâ€”particularly as Zambia transitions to cost-reflective and time-of-use tariffs.
